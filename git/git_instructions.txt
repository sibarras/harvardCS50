Create an repository in github
git clone <url>
create and modify files
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"
git status
git push

To add all files you changed and commit, use this command:
git commit -am "message"

you can have a merge conflict if two persons modify the same line or the same file
To solve this, git add metadata in the code with lines than mark the conflict site.
You have to modify this to continue in the pull or push

git log is to see all changes in the repository

git reset take the current state repository and reverted back to a previous state.
examples:
git reset --hard <commit hash>
git reset --hard origin/master
